# React Native FlatList State Update Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native when updating the state associated with a FlatList component.  The issue is characterized by inconsistent rendering or stale data display after a state update, particularly noticeable with large datasets.

The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `FlatListBugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution using `keyExtractor` and `getItemLayout` to improve rendering performance.  The solution improves efficiency by providing React Native with more information about the list items, allowing for faster updates and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
4. Run the project using your preferred React Native development environment (e.g., `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
5. Observe the performance differences between the original and the solution.
