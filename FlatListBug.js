This React Native bug is related to the interaction between FlatList and state updates. When using FlatList, especially with a large dataset, updating the state can cause performance issues or unexpected behavior.  The problem is that when the state changes, React Native might not correctly re-render the FlatList, leading to stale data or inconsistent UI.
