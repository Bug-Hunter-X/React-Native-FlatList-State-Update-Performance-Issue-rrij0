The solution involves implementing `keyExtractor` and `getItemLayout` in the FlatList component.  `keyExtractor` provides a unique key for each item, enabling React Native to efficiently track changes and re-renders only what's necessary. `getItemLayout` provides layout information for each item, further optimizing rendering performance.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: ITEM_HEIGHT,
    offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index,
    index,
  })}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```

By adding `keyExtractor` and `getItemLayout`, React Native can more efficiently update the FlatList's rendering, leading to improved performance and avoiding the stale data/inconsistent UI problem.
